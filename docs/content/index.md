## Overview

The Threat Exposure Notification Protocol defines a HTTP- and
JSON-based protocol for uploading and querying diagnosis keys
collected by devices. This protocol does not specify how
contacts or exposures are collected, as there are other
protocols for that such as those from Google/Apple and TCN Protocol.

## Contributing

We intend for this specification to be an open standard and
welcome other contributors and collaborators to ensure the
protocol is as widely usable as possible.

Start by creating an Issue in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tenprotocol/tenprotocol),
